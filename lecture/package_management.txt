PyPI - Python package index - repository of Python packages

pip - Python package installer tool

Virtual environments - useful for managing different dependencies needed
for different Python projects

setup.py - when distributing project, need a way to describe the project and
it's dependencies

    - create a setup.py file that will contain info about your package and
    instructions on which dependencies should be fetched/installed

    - a packaging tool, like setuptools, reads setup.py when package is
    downloaded and installed, dependencies are fetched and installed

requirements.txt - list of dependencies - used instead of or as well as
setup.py usually during development


pip install <package name>

pip connects to PyPI - locates, downloads, and installs requested packages

Use virtual environments and install specific project dependencies in it
Allows for each project to run in its own environment with just its own dependencies

Go to directory to create virtual environment in and run commands:
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate

use deactivate to leave virtual environment

To copy all dependencies into file:
pip freeze >> requirements.txt

To install required dependencies based off requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt
